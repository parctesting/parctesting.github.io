		  <br>(If it is an iPhone ask them to click on cancel)

<ol><li>This is a timed exam, so please complete the test without any interruptions.</li>
<li>You agree to keep attention on your computer screen at all times. Don’t let your eyes wander to other parts of the room and don’t leave your seat during the exam.</li>

<li>You cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors.</li>

<li>You will NOT be able to use scrap paper, manual calculators, or any other kind of assistance, however, you may pre-load an on-screen calculator app. <p2>Do you want to use a calculator app?</p2> <h5><strong>(If there are multiple applicants, ask them to raise their hands)</strong></h5></li>
<li>Please move the calculator app all the way to the left side of your screen.</li>
<li>You should only have on your screen the calculator app and the zoom app. All browsers, emails, notifications, and notes must not only be closed, but they have to be shut down and quit completely.</li>
</ol>

<h4><em><center>START EXAM</center></em></h4>
	  
	  <h5><strong>* DO NOT READ * Have them position the bottom edge of the browser below, “Exam history” and above, “No exams have been taken”. This position will ensure they get the schematics with the questions.</strong></h5>
<ol>

<li>After you verify your information is correct please click “START _____ EXAM”</li>

<li>To select your answers for the questions, simply press the “A”, “B”, “C”, or “D” keys on the keyboard. This will not only mark your answer, it will also automatically advance to the next question and light it up. The questions will be bottom justified because some questions have schematics above them.</li>

<li>In the top right corner, you will see the number of questions remaining. Please move your mouse pointer up to that spot now.</li>
	
<h5>Verify they put the mouse pointer on top of the word remaining.</h5>

<li>You will not use your mouse or trackpad anymore except for your calculator. If you do use your calculator, you will need to click on the word remaining to refocus to the exam page and begin using the letters again. </li>

<li>When you have answered all of the questions, that will change to a “GRADE EXAM” button. After you finish, press the GRADE EXAM button without any further prompting from us, and we will come back with your score. </li>
	
<li>We will now turn off all of our video and audio so that we don’t distract you. However, you must keep both of your devices active throughout the exam.</li>

<li>GOOD LUCK! You may begin!</li></ol>
