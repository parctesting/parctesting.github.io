<ol><li>This is a timed exam, so please complete the test without any interruptions.</li>
<li>You agree to keep attention on your computer screen at all times. Don’t let your eyes wander to other parts of the room and don’t leave your seat during the exam.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to read any questions or answers out loud and you cannot talk to yourself.</li>
<li>At this time, you need to remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.</li>
<li>You cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors.</li>
<li>In a moment you will use your cell phone camera to scan the room, then place it so it views you, your monitor, your keyboard, and both of your hands.</li>
<li>You will NOT be able to use scrap paper, manual calculators, or any other kind of assistance, however, you may pre-load an on-screen calculator app. <p2>Do you want to use a calculator app?</p2> </li>
<li>Please move the calculator app all the way to the left side of your screen at this time.</li>
