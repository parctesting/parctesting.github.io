<h4><center><u>MAIN ROOM SCRIPT</u></center></h4><br>
<h5><center>Before we begin, we want to bring your phone into the session. Is your phone and iPhone or something else? <br>
(If it is an iPhone ask them to click on cancel) <br>
(If it is something else, ask them to click on your image, not any of the selections in the dialogue box)</h5></center><br>
	<ol>
<li>This is a timed exam, so you will need to complete the test without any interruptions.</li>
<br>
<li>You agree to keep attention on your computer screen at all times. Don’t let your eyes wander to other parts of the room and don’t leave your seat during the exam.</li>
<br>
<li>You are not allowed to read any questions or answers out loud and you cannot talk to yourself.</li>
<br>
<li>You must remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.</li>
<br>
<li>You cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors.</li>
<br>
<li>Since you cannot use scrap paper or manual calculators, you can use an on-screen calculator app.
Do you want to use a calculator app?</li>
<br>
<li>Please move the calculator app all the way to the left side of your screen.</li>
<br>
<li>You should only have on your screen the calculator app and the zoom app. All browsers, emails, notifications, and notes must not only be closed, but they have to be shut down and quit completely.</li>
<br>
<li>FOR THE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS, WE NEED A SIMPLE YES OR NO VERBAL RESPONSE.</li>
<br>
<li>Do you agree to share your entire screen with the exam team, not just the browser?</li>
<br>
<li>Do you agree that the exam session will be recorded and stored for up to 30 days in case of any question about a possible breach of exam protocol?</li>
<br>
<li>Do you agree that if the Exam Team suspects a possibility of cheating, they will terminate your exam, your exam fee will be forfeited, and you will be barred from taking any future online exams?</li>
<br>
<li>Great, now please hold your driver’s license up to the camera on your computer screen close and steady.</li>
<br>
<li>Please place it on your computer now for the VE’s to see when you are in the break-out room for your exam.</li>
<br>
<li>You will not need any other papers or documents. Not even a PIN or FRN so place them in a drawer out of view along with any other papers or documents.</li>
		</ol>
<h4>ROOM SCAN</h4>
<ol><li>Now take your cellphone, change to your rear camera, not your selfie camera. Stand up and step away from your computer at least 6 feet. Point your camera back toward your computer and scan the area.</li>
<br>
<li>Standing in the center of the room, make a 360 degree turn without stopping in the same direction with your camera.</li>
<br>
<li>Reverse your camera back to the selfie camera and place your phone where it views your monitor, keyboard, and hands.</li></ol><br>

<br>
<li>* DO NOT READ * Make sure all apps and processes are quit except for zoom and a calculator app.</li>
<li>* DO NOT READ * Move the calculator to the left side of the screen.</li>
<br>
<li>Open the browser and narrow it down so that it fits between the calculator app and the zoom app. The exam is only 3 to 4 inches wide so narrow it down now.</li>
<br>
<li>Type in the URL bar at the top of the browser “EXAM.TOOLS” and press enter.</li>
<br>
<li>Select “JOIN EXAM SESSION”.</li>
<br>
<li>In the exam you will not use your mouse or trackpad. To select your answers for the questions, simply press the “A”, “B”, “C”, or “D” keys on your keyboard. This will not only mark your answer, it will also automatically advance to the next question. It will bottom justify the questions because some questions have schematics above them.</li>
