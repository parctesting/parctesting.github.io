<h5><center>ATTENTION: All VE’s please mute your microphone at this time.<br>
<br>
Before we begin, we want to bring your phone into the session. Is your phone and iPhone or something else? <br>
(If it is an iPhone ask them to click on cancel) <br>
(If it is something else, ask them to click on your image, not any of the selections in the dialogue box)</center></h5><br></center>
	  
<h5>HOW TO STOP FEEDBACK ON ZOOM (Phone):

<ol>
<li>Open the Zoom App.</li>
<li>Navigate through the screens:</li>
<ul>*The first screen is "Tap to Speak."<br>
*The second screen is "Current Speaker."<br>
*The third screen is "Multiview."</ul>
<li>On the "Multiview" page, tap the center of the screen.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the screen, you will see a menu that includes "Mute/Unmute," "Start/Stop Video," "Participants," "Chat," and more.</li>
<li>Scroll to the right end of this menu until you see "More" (three dots).</li>
<li>Tap on "More" and scroll to the bottom.</li>
<li>Select "Disconnect Audio."	</li>  
</ol>	</h5>  
<ol>Before we get started, we would like to ask how you found PARC Radio to take your exams?
(If they need prompting suggest, “Was it through ARRL, Ham Radio Pre, hamstudy.org, etc.?”)
<br><br>
		  <P2><strong><center>Pre-Read</center></strong></p2><br>
</center>
		  <ol>
<li>We will need you to complete the test without any interruptions.</li>
<br>
<li>Please keep your attention on your computer screen at all times. Don’t let your eyes wander to other parts of the room and don’t leave your seat during the exam.
</li>
<br>
<li>You are not allowed to read any questions or answers out loud and you cannot talk to yourself. Mouthing the words, even if no sound is coming out, IS talking to yourself.</li><br>
<li>You must remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.</li>

<br>
			  <li>You cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors during the room scan.</li><br>
<li>Since you cannot use scrap paper or manual calculators, you can use an on-screen calculator app.<br><p2>Do you want to use a calculator app?</p2> <h5><strong>(If there are multiple applicants, ask them to raise their hands)</strong></h5></li><br>
<li>Move the calculator to the left side of the screen. Put it in Basic / Standard Mode and make it as small as possible.</li>
<br>
<li>You should only have on your screen the calculator app and the zoom app. All browsers, emails, notifications, and notes must not only be closed, but they have to be shut down and quit completely.</li>
	<br>
<li>
We are going to put you back in the waiting room while we prepare your exams and then bring you in one at a time to take your exam. Please have your ID ready.</li>
</ol>Good luck, and see you soon.<br><br>

<h4><em><center>POST EXAM INFORMATION</center></em></h4><br>
<ul>
<li><strong><p5>NEW:</strong> We will email you a CSCE. Please note the FCC is shut down and will not process applications, payments, or licenses until it reopens. When the FCC reopens, your exam will be submitted, and the FCC will email you a link with payment instructions. You will have 10 days to pay directly to the FCC. After payment, the FCC will send a final email with a link to your Official License, valid for 30 days. Do not make any edits or modifications during that 30-day period, as it may delay or void your application. Initial applicants may be waiting weeks or months depending on the length of the shutdown. </li><br>
	
<li><strong><p5>NO FRN: </strong>Since you do not yet have an FRN, your exam results cannot be submitted to the FCC until you obtain one. When the FCC reopens, go to fcc.gov/uls to create your account, and get your FRN. Email it to vetesting@yahoo.com with the subject line FRN so we can forward your results for processing. If you already have an FRN from any other FCC service, send that one instead. Once we receive it, your application will be submitted. </li><br>

<li><strong><p2>UPGRADE:</strong> We will email you a CSCE. The CSCE includes instructions showing how to verify your upgrade online. You may begin using your new privileges immediately by following the instructions on your CSCE, with your current license. The FCC will update its records once it reopens. Do not make any edits or modifications until 30 days after the update appears in the FCC system. </li><br>

<li><strong><p6></p2>FOR YOUTH ONLY:</strong> Since you tested with PARC, you qualify for reimbursement of your $35 FCC exam fee from the ARRL. Visit our website for details on claiming reimbursement after your license callsign is issued. Reimbursement is only possible after the FCC issues your license, which may be delayed until the FCC reopens. 
</li><br>
<li><strong><p6>FOR LADIES ONLY:</strong> Within the amateur radio community, there exists a dedicated organization for women known as the Young Ladies Radio League (YLRL). We encourage you to explore this organization as it provides valuable information and opportunities tailored specifically for women in our hobby. Go to YLRL.org for more information. <br>
	<br>
<li><strong><p6>FOR EXTRA CLASS ONLY:</strong> Congratulations on reaching the pinnacle of amateur radio! As an Extra Class license holder, we are excited to invite you to join our club at PARC Radio and become a Volunteer Examiner. This is a fantastic opportunity to give back to the community and support fellow hobbyists. <br>
<br>You can choose to volunteer based on your availability, whether it's daily, weekly, or monthly. We would be thrilled to have you on board. <br>
<br>If you're interested, please email us at parcve@yahoo.com. We will provide you with all the necessary details. <br>
<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
	
<ol>
<li>Important!!! The FCC CORES system is currently offline, and no paperwork of any kind will be processed until it reopens. Please allow at least ten days after the FCC reopens before contacting us or the FCC about your application. Check your spam and junk folders and the FCC CORES site before reaching out. Do not make any edits or modifications during the 30-day license window after the FCC issues your license. </li><br>
	
<li>If you take additional exams with us during the shutdown, we will submit all your results 
together once the FCC reopens, and you will receive the highest license class earned. </li><br>
	
<li>We encourage you to join the ARRL and get involved in your local radio club when you can.</li><br>

<li>Thank you for taking an exam with us. We would welcome you or your friends to a future exam. We look forward to hearing you on the air soon.</li><br>
<p2><strong>PAUSE FOR CONGRATULATIONS AND COMMENTS!</p2></strong> <br>
<li>Q: Do you have any questions or comments before we let you go?  </li><br>
<li>For any inquiries or feedback following today's interaction, we recommend reaching out to us via our Facebook page for a quicker response than email. Alternatively, you can find answers to most questions on our FAQ page on our website.</li><br>
<li>You are now free to leave the meeting. You can click the blue or red “LEAVE” button in the bottom right corner of your screen to leave the session. Click the red "LEAVE MEETING" button.</li><br>
