<ol><li>We will need you to complete the test without any interruptions.</li>
<br>
<li>Please keep your attention on your computer screen at all times. Don’t let your eyes wander to other parts of the room and don’t leave your seat during the exam.
</li>
<br>
<li>You are not allowed to read any questions or answers out loud and you cannot talk to yourself.</li><br>
<li>You must remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.</li>
<br>
<li>You cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors.</li>
<br>
<li>Since you cannot use scrap paper or manual calculators, you can use an on-screen calculator app.<br><p2>Do you want to use a calculator app?</p2> </li><br>
<li>Please move the calculator app all the way to the left side of your screen.</li>
<br>
<li>You should only have on your screen the calculator app and the zoom app. All browsers, emails, notifications, and notes must not only be closed, but they have to be shut down and quit completely.</li><br>
<li><strong><u>FOR THE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS, WE NEED A SIMPLE YES OR NO VERBAL RESPONSE.</u></strong></li><br>
<li><strong>Do you agree to share your entire screen with the exam team, </strong>not just the browser?</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Do you agree that the exam session will be recorded and stored for up to 30 days </strong>in case of any question about a possible breach of exam protocol?</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Do you agree that if the Exam Team suspects a possibility of cheating, they will terminate your exam, your exam fee will be forfeited, and you will be barred from taking any future online exams?</strong></li></ol>

<ol>

	<br>

<li>To select your answers for the questions, simply press the “A”, “B”, “C”, or “D” keys on the keyboard.

<li>We will now turn off all of our video and audio so that we don’t distract you. However, you must keep both of your devices active throughout the exam.</li>
