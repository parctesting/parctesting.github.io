	  <h5><strong><center>ATTENTION: All VE’s please mute your microphone at this time.</center><br>
		  <center>Before we begin, we want to bring your phone into the session. Is your phone and iPhone or something else? 
		  <br>(If it is an iPhone ask them to click on cancel)
		  <br>(If it is something else, ask them to click on your image, not any of the selections in the dialogue box)</strong></h5></center><p><br>
<br>
		  <ol><li>This is a timed exam, so you will need to complete the test without any interruptions.</li><br>
<li>You agree to keep attention on your computer screen at all times. Don’t let your eyes wander to other parts of the room and don’t leave your seat during the exam.</li> <br>
<li>You are not allowed to read any questions or answers out loud and you cannot talk to yourself.</li><br>
<li>You must remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.</li>
<br>
<li>You cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors.</li>
<br>
<li>Since you cannot use scrap paper or manual calculators, you can use an on-screen calculator app.<br><p2>Do you want to use a calculator app?</p2> <h5><strong>(If there are multiple applicants, ask them to raise their hands)</strong></h5></li><br>
<li>Please move the calculator app all the way to the left side of your screen.</li>
<br>
<li>You should only have on your screen the calculator app and the zoom app. All browsers, emails, notifications, and notes must not only be closed, but they have to be shut down and quit completely.</li><br>
</ol>


<h4><center>
  <em>IDENTIFICATION</em>
</center></h4><br>
<ol><li>Please hold your driver’s license up to the camera on your computer screen close and steady.</li>
  <br>
<li>Flip it around to the back side.</li><br>
<li>Put that in your back pocket or a drawer, out of view along with any other papers or documents.</li>
</ol>
	  <h5><center>
	    *STOP HERE FOR MULTI-CANDIDATE INSTRUCTIONS - BEGIN BELOW FOR INDIVIDUAL READING OF INSTRUCTIONS*
		  <br><br>
    </center></h5>
	  <h4><center><em>Please start recording now.</em></h4></center>
<ol><li>We need you to verify that you have read the website instructions and agreed to the following terms:</li><br>
<li>That you will share your entire screen.</li>
<br>
<li>For the exam session will be recorded and stored.</li><br>
<li>And if the Exam Team suspects a possibility of cheating, they will terminate your exam, the exam fee will be forfeited, and you will be barred from taking any future online exams?</li><br>
	  <li>Please answer with a yes or no.</li></ol>

<h4><center>
  <em>ROOM SCAN</em>
</center></h4>
<ol><li>Now take your cellphone, change to your rear camera, not your selfie camera. Stand up behind your chair about 2 to 5 feet if you can. Point your camera toward your computer and scan the area holding the phone horizontal.</li>
  <br>
<li>Now hold your phone vertically. While standing in the same spot, make a 360 degree turn without stopping in the same direction with your camera.</li><br>
<li>Please turn your phone back horizontal and set the phone where it views your monitor, keyboard, and hands.</li></ol>
 
<h4><em><center>SCREEN SHARE</center></em></h4>
<br>
<ol><li>On the laptop press the “SHARE SCREEN” button at the bottom of the screen. It is the green button.</li><br>
<li>Then press the “SHARE” button in the bottom right hand corner of that dialog box. It is the blue button.</li><br>
<li><strong>Is anyone using a Mac computer?</strong><br>
Look across your task bar for any dots under the applications. The only apps that may have a dot under them are the finder, Calculator, and Zoom apps. You MUST use force quit to close any extra apps. Look at the top left corner of your screen for the apple, then the fifth item down is force quit. Give me a thumbs up when you have completed this task. <br>*PAUSE AND VERIFY THEY FOUND IT*<br>
Hold your command key and click all items other than finder, calculator, and zoom. Then click force quit. Give me a thumbs up when you have completed this task. <br>*PAUSE AND VERIFY THEY FOUND IT*<br>
<br>
<strong>Is anyone using a PC?</strong><br>
Look across your task bar for any bars or lines under the applications. The only apps that may have a line under them are the Calculator and Zoom apps. You will also need to go to the bottom right-hand corner of the screen and look to the right of the time and date. You are looking for a text balloon, it may or may not have a number on it, and right click on it. Then click focus assist followed by clicking priority only. Give me a thumbs up when you have completed this task.<br>
*PAUSE AND VERIFY THEY FOUND IT*<br>

Right click on the task bar to open Task Manager. (If this fails click CONTROL-SHIFT-ESCAPE all at once) Make sure all applications are closed except the ones we are using. Give me a thumbs up when you have completed this task.<br>
*PAUSE AND VERIFY THEY FOUND IT*<br></li>
	<br>
<li><h8>* DO NOT READ * Make sure all apps and processes are quit except for zoom and a calculator app.</h8></li><br>
<li>Move the calculator to the left side of the screen.</li><br>
<li>Open the browser and narrow it down so that it fits between the calculator app and the zoom app. The exam is only 3 to 4 inches wide so narrow it down now.</li><br>
<li>Type in the URL bar at the top of the browser “EXAM.TOOLS” and press enter.</li><br>
<li>Click on the “I UNDERSTAND” button in the green bar at the bottom.</li><br>
<li><h8><strong>*IF IN DARK MODE*</strong></h8> Click on the black/white moon in the bottom right corner.</li><br>
<li>Select “JOIN EXAM SESSION”.</li><br>
<li>On the top line type the callsign “KJ4PJE”.</li></ol>

<h4><em><center>START EXAM</center></em></h4>
	  <h5><strong>* DO NOT READ * Have them position the bottom edge of the browser below, “Exam history” and above, “No exams have been taken”. This position will ensure they get the schematics with the questions.</strong></h5>
<br>
	  
<ol>

<li>After you verify your information is correct please click “START _____ EXAM”</li><br>

<li>To select your answers for the questions, simply press the “A”, “B”, “C”, or “D” keys on the keyboard. This will not only mark your answer, it will also automatically advance to the next question and light it up. The questions will be bottom justified because some questions have schematics above them.</li><br>

<li>In the top right corner, you will see the number of questions remaining. Please move your mouse pointer up to that spot now.</li><br>
	
<h5>Verify they put the mouse pointer on top of the word remaining.</h5><br>

<li>You will not use your mouse or trackpad anymore for the exam.</li>
	<br>
<h5><strong>*READ ONLY IF USING A CALCULATOR*</strong></h5> <li>If you need to use your calculator, you may use the mouse, but then you will need to click on the word remaining to refocus to the exam page and begin using the letters again.</li>
<br>

<li>When you have answered all of the questions, that will change to a gold “GRADE EXAM” button. After you finish, press the gold GRADE EXAM button without any further prompting from us, and that will give us your score.</li><br>
	
<li>We will now turn off all of our video and audio so that we don’t distract you. However, you must keep both of your devices active throughout the exam.</li><br>

<li>GOOD LUCK! You may begin!</li></ol>

<h4><em><center>FINISH EXAM</center></em></h4>
<br>
<ol><li>Please click the “GRADE EXAM” button and we will get your score.</li><br>
<li>Click on the “FINISH AND SIGN FORMS” button, that is the gold button.</li><br>
<li>Click on “FINISH AND SIGN”</li><br>
<li>Now scroll to the bottom of the page and type your name on the line below the red sentence where says “FULL NAME OF SIGNER”.</li>
<br>
<li>Now scribble your signature into the “SIGN HERE” box.</li><br>
<li>Once you have finished with your signature, click on “SIGN DOCUMENTS”, the green button below the box.</li>
<br>
<li>Click on “FINISH SESSION”. </li><br>
<li>Click on “LOG OUT”</li><br>
	  <li>We will now stop recording and sharing your screen.</li></ol>
<h4><em><center>POST EXAM INFORMATION</center></em></h4>
<br>
<ol><li>We will be emailing you a CSCE. On that CSCE there are instructions on how you can go online and get your callsign. (or upgrade) It will be available online by the end of next week.</li><br>

<li>We encourage you to join the ARRL and get involved in your local radio club when you can.</li><br>

<li>Thank you for taking an exam with us. We would welcome you or your friends to a future exam. We look forward to hearing you on the air soon.</li><br>
