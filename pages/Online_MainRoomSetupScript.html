<h5><center>ATTENTION: All VE’s please mute your microphone at this time.<br>
<br>
Before we begin, we want to bring your phone into the session. Is your phone and iPhone or something else? <br>
(If it is an iPhone ask them to click on cancel) <br>
(If it is something else, ask them to click on your image, not any of the selections in the dialogue box)</center></h5><br></center>
<ol>
  Before we get started, we would like to ask how you found PARC Radio to take your exams?
(If they need prompting suggest, “Was it through ARRL, Ham Radio Prep, hamstudy.org, etc.?”)<br><br>
<li>We will need you to complete the test without any interruptions.</li>
<br>
<li>Please keep your attention on your computer screen at all times. Don’t let your eyes wander to other parts of the room and don’t leave your seat during the exam.
</li>
<br>

<li>You are not allowed to read any questions or answers out loud and you cannot talk to yourself. Mouthing the words, even if no sound is coming out, IS talking to yourself.</li><br>

<li>You must remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.</li><br>

<li>You cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors.</li><br>

<li>Move the calculator to the left side of the screen. Put it in Basic / Standard Mode and make it as small as possible.</li><br>

<li>You should only have on your screen the calculator app and the zoom app. All browsers, emails, notifications, and notes must not only be closed, but they have to be shut down and quit completely.</li><br>

<li>You will share your entire screen.</li><br>

Show us the right side of the computer. <br>
Show us the back of the computer.<br>
