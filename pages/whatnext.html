<strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br>
We are not required to provide the following information and links. We do this to help and assist 
you as we welcome you into the great hobby of Amateur Radio. 	  
	  <br><br><br><br>
	  <h2>FCC Processing Update – November 2025 </h2><br>
The recent government shutdown has officially ended. However, the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) has not yet resumed normal operations. The FCC is expected to reopen the 
week of November 17, 2025. <br><br>
Once reopened, their systems will be heavily backlogged. Applications will be processed in 
order of exam date, which means your paperwork will move through the queue behind earlier 
exams. Depending on when you tested, it could take several weeks before you see any updates in 
the FCC database. <br><br>
The FCC’s backend licensing system is a legacy platform with older architecture and known 
stability issues. Many federal business systems of this vintage use older languages such as 
COBOL. This can contribute to processing delays and occasional system crashes.<br><br> 
With the post-shutdown backlog, outages and slow processing are likely. Only a small number of 
qualified personnel can maintain these systems, so recovery from system failures can take days. <br><br><br><br>
	  <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do you have a real FRN?</strong><br>
	If you took your exam without an FRN or used Ten Zeroes, you must apply for an FRN before your exam can be submitted to the FCC. If you already have an FRN from the FCC for any license, that is your FRN. You only get one, like an SSN. As soon as possible, go to the FCC CORES website, register for an account, and obtain your FRN. Email that FRN to PARC with a subject line of “FRN.” We will update your paperwork and submit your application to the FCC. That is when your timer begins for receiving your license. See instructions below. 
	
<br><br>
	Format your Subject line exactly like this please: "FRN - 0031234567 - First Name Last Name"
<br><br>
<li><strong>Pay your $35 license fee as soon as the system allows it.</strong><br> 
	When the payment system comes back online, submit your payment promptly to secure your place in the queue.</li> 
<li><strong>Watch your email closely.</strong><br>
	The FCC will send an email to the address listed on your Form 605 once their system begins processing. This email contains the payment instructions. Check your spam and junk folders regularly. Missing this email or failing to pay in time will result in your application being dismissed, and you will have to begin the process again.</li> 
<li><strong>Felony documentation.</strong><br>
	If you have a felony conviction, submit the required documentation as soon as the FCC systems are back online. This process is strictly between you and the FCC — we cannot assist or intervene.</li> 
<li><strong>Do not contact the FCC, ARRL, or us about your paperwork.</strong><br>
	The FCC’s public call center is operated by a contractor and may not have accurate information during recovery. Patience is required until the systems are operational.</li></ol>
	  
<ol><strong>How to Apply for an FCC FRN (Simple Instructions)</strong> 
<li>Go to the FCC CORES website by searching “FCC CORES Login” in your browser.</li> 
<li>Click “Register” or “Create an Account.”</li> 
<li>Enter your email address and create a password.</li> 
<li>After you sign in, select “Register for a New FRN.”</li> 
<li>Choose “Individual.”</li> 
<li>Fill in your name and contact information.</li> 
<li>Submit the form.</li> 
<li>Your new FRN will appear on the confirmation page. Write it down for future use.</li> </ol>
	  
<ol><strong>How to Pay Your FCC License Application Fee of 35 Dollars in Advance</strong> 
<li>Go to the FCC CORES website by searching “FCC CORES Login.”</li> 
<li>Sign in using your email and password.</li> 
<li>On the main page, select “Submit a New Filing.”</li> 
<li>Choose “ULS Application Fee.”</li> 
<li>Enter your FRN and confirm your information.</li> 
<li>Select the 35 dollar Amateur Radio License Fee.</li> 
<li>Follow the prompts to pay by credit card or bank transfer.</li> 
<li>Save or print your payment confirmation for your records.</li></ol><br><br>
	  
<h2>When to Expect Progress </h2>
<ul><li>Once the FCC systems reopen, licenses will be issued in order of exam date. </li>
<li>Upgrades and new licenses will process as soon as payment and verification steps are 
complete. </li>
<li>You may see your call sign appear in the FCC ULS database within days or it may take 
several weeks depending on the backlog.</li> 
<li>If you have already paid and do not see your license after several weeks, it is likely still 
in the queue. Do not worry.</li> 
<li>Once the systems stabilize, all pending applications will continue to move normally.</li></ul><br><br>
	  
	  
<h2>Helpful Tips </h2>
<ul><li>Paying promptly is the best way to avoid unnecessary delays. </li>
<li>Keep monitoring email and FCC notices, but do not worry about contacting us or the 
FCC unnecessarily.</li> 
<li>Remember that backlogs are normal after system outages and shutdowns. Patience is key.</li></ul> <br><br>
