<h1>What’s Next – Welcome to Amateur Radio!</h1><br>


<p2><center>Clear instructions and useful links to guide you after passing your exam</center></p2><br><ul>
<strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br>
We are not required to provide the following information and links. We do this to help and assist 
you as we welcome you into the great hobby of Amateur Radio. 	  
	  <br><br><br><br>

<li><strong>Pay your $35 license fee as soon as the system allows it.</strong><br> 
	When the payment system comes back online, submit your payment promptly to secure your place in the queue.</li> 
<li><strong>Watch your email closely.</strong><br>
	The FCC will send an email to the address listed on your Form 605 once their system begins processing. This email contains the payment instructions. Check your spam and junk folders regularly. Missing this email or failing to pay in time will result in your application being dismissed, and you will have to begin the process again.</li> 
<li><strong>Felony documentation.</strong><br>
	If you have a felony conviction, submit the required documentation as soon as the FCC systems are back online. This process is strictly between you and the FCC - we cannot assist or intervene..</li> 
<li><strong>Do not contact the FCC, ARRL, or us about your paperwork.</strong><br>
	The FCC’s public call center is operated by a contractor and may not have accurate information, patience is. If you have not received an email within ten days, email us to check on your application for you. </li></ol>
	  

	  
<ol><strong>How to Pay Your FCC License Application Fee of 35 Dollars in Advance</strong> 
<li>Go to the FCC CORES website by searching “FCC CORES Login.”</li> 
<li>Sign in using your email and password.</li> 
<li>On the main page, select “Submit a New Filing.”</li> 
<li>Choose “ULS Application Fee.”</li> 
<li>Enter your FRN and confirm your information.</li> 
<li>Select the 35 dollar Amateur Radio License Fee.</li> 
<li>Follow the prompts to pay by credit card or bank transfer.</li> 
	<li>Save or print your payment confirmation for your records.</li></ol><br><br></ul>
	  
<h2>When to Expect Progress </h2>
<ul><li>New licenses are issued in order of payment date.</li>
<li>Upgrades and new licenses will process as soon as payment 
and/or verification steps are complete.</li> 
<li>You may see your call sign appear in the FCC ULS database 
within days or it may take several weeks depending on the 
backlog.</li>
<li>If you have already paid and do not see your license after ten 
days, contact the FCC at their toll-free number (888) 225-5322. </li>
</ul><br><br>
	  
	  
<h2>Helpful Tips </h2>
<ul><li>Paying promptly is the best way to avoid unnecessary delays. </li>
<li>Keep monitoring email and FCC notices, but do not worry about contacting us or the 
FCC unnecessarily. It can take up to ten days. </li> 
<li>Remember that backlogs are normal after system outages and shutdowns. Patience is key.</li></ul> <br><br>
