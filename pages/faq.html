<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Will you give an online exam to a person who is not a citizen of the USA?</strong></li>
Yes, we give exams to persons who possess proper photo ID issued by the US Government or a state of the USA. This ID must be a state issued driver’s license, a state issued non-driver’s license, or a US Passport. Any ID used must have been issued within the last five years. Up to ten years if an unexpired Star ID or unexpired passport (must have your valid current residential address, no business, mail service, or non-residential addresses).Non-US Passports are not accepted for online exams. Citizenship is NOT a requirement. For persons under 18, they may present two forms of ID from the ID list as long as a parent or guardian with one of the three forms of ID above is present and identifies themselves and the minor. Do NOT schedule an exam if you do not have the proper ID. Failure to provide the above required documents will result in the exam session being terminated without any refund.<br>
	NOTE: Any identification presented must be a physical ID. No Mobile ID, photocopy, facsimile or other virtual type identification will be accepted.<br>
	<br>
<li><strong>I do not have a cell phone with a camera, can I still take an exam online?</strong></li>
You must have a second device with a camera  that will be placed to view your computer screen, keyboard, and your hands for the entire exam session. Some people have been successful using an iPad as their second device. However, it is up to the discretion of the exam team if the placement and view of the second device is acceptable. If you do not have a second device, you will need to find and in-person exam session for your exam. <u><strong>TWO DEVICES WITH THE ZOOM APPLICATION AND A CAMERA THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE DURATION OF THE EXAM ARE REQUIRED!</strong></u>
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Can I use an iPad or notebook for my computer to take my exam?</strong></li>
Online Exams: No, we require a camera view of your face for the duration of the exam. These devices typically shut of the camera when sharing the screen and that is not acceptable. You must use a laptop or desktop that has a camera in the center of the screen looking at your face as well as the second camera device to the side.
<br>
In-Person Exams: Yes, as long as it can be determined there is no assistive software on the device, you may be permitted to use your device at the exam. This is at the discretion of the exam team.
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>My exam session time has passed, and I am still in the waiting room, what should I do?</strong></li>
Be patient, if you are in the waiting room, that means you have received a link and are on the schedule. Some people take longer than others and can cause the online sessions to run behind. Rest assured that you will be brought into the exam session as quickly as the exam team can get you in. Also, this is a good time to make sure your devices are name properly. If the exam team does not see your name on your device, you will not get admitted until everyone else has been tested, if at all. Watch the “chat” in Zoom for messages. Use this time to review our website or study.
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>I cannot figure out how to rename my devices, what should I do?</strong></li>
You cannot rename your devices from the waiting room. You will need to go to the zoom website and sign into your account. Change the first and last name to reflect your name. Then add “computer” or “phone” after your last name in the last name field. Save and remain logged into your zoom account. Now go back to the email and click on the link.
You cannot rename devices once you are in the waiting room. You have to rename your devices before you join the session. You do this in your profile. Understand that you must use the Zoom application which you must download. You cannot run Zoom in a browser. To rename your devices, you can follow these instructions at these links to complete the process:<br>

<li><strong>What are donations for?</strong></li>
The Donation Link is not a requirement or a request for registering for exam sessions. The link is on all pages of our website for those that want to contribute to the operation of our group. Donations are used to build equipment, teach radio classes, provide internet, subscriptions, power, training and other operations of the club. While we do use a lot of this money for infrastructure to conduct online exams, that is not all it is used for. Neither club is supported by funds from any school or group. The funding is completely provided by members donations and the donations of others in the ham community. Remember, there is no request to make a donation as a requirement to take an exam. Any donations are greatly appreciated and are totally independent of our testing activities which we provide as a way to help the amateur radio community.

<br>
<li><strong>Can I use a mouse or external keyboard?</strong></li>
No! You will not need them, and they are not allowed. To navigate the exam, you will use the keys A, B, C, and D on your keyboard to select the correct answer on the question. This will not only answer the question, it will automatically advance to the next question and light it up for you to answer. The question will be bottom justified to make sure you can see any schematics which would appear above the question. The small amount of adjustments is easily done using a trackpad. If you are using a PC, of course you can use the mouse for that portion of setting up your exam.
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>What happens if I miss my exam timeslot?</strong></li>
Please respect the time of the volunteer examiners along with any candidates that are waiting to take their exam after you.
