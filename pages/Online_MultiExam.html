 <br>
Please refrain from contacting us or the FCC about your license status until ten business days have passed. For quick answers, refer to our FAQ section.

	<p><center>We have a limit due to the Zoom System Sessions and being able to give as many people the opportunity to take an exam as possible. With advance request it is possible to provide additional elements. There is a requirement for your practice pass percentage, time per element, and availability of multiple time-slots that are back to back on a given day.

<center><div id="example2">Failure to thoroughly review both the procedures page and FAQ page on our website may lead to termination of your exam. Should we grant you access to the exam room and observe that you are unprepared or have not followed the specified procedures, you will be returned to the waiting room, and the next candidate will be considered. If unpreparedness persists on a subsequent attempt, you will be required to schedule a new exam.</div></center>
	  <br>
<p>If your Payment email is not the same as the email you register with, we will not be able to match your payment to the exam. Make sure your name or your email match for payment and your registration. Email us immediately for any discrepancies. You may still receive a non-payment notice, since the system will not match up your payment automatically. Please be warned that variances in name and email can cause deletion.</p><br>

<ul><li>PARC VE Testing Team has received permission of the ARRL VEC and the FCC to conduct completely online video-supervised testing with strict rules and protocols for maintaining the integrity of the testing environment.</li>
  <br>
<br>


</ul>

<h1>Warning: You must be fully prepared for an online exam</h1><br>
	<ul>

<li>The ONLINE system is  more complicated and time consuming than a regular in-person exam. You MUST read and follow all the protocol on this page. Exams require a minimum of 3 volunteer examiners per session and only 1 candidate can be tested by them at a time. To be sure no one can cheat, you will be asked to scan all around the room and verify the integrity of the exam environment. You and your exam session will be recorded. If you are not comfortable with this, please consider taking the exam in-person at a future date. By signing up for an exam, you agree that you will cover any sensitive items in the room or you consent to the scanning and recording of those items.</li>
<br>
<li>Please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are waiting to take their exam after your exam is complete. You do this by being FULLY PREPARED. Please READ this page completely and also the FAQ page completely. Remember, this takes not only the time it takes to give you your exam, it also takes time for the VE’s to prepare for your exam and for the team to complete and submit your paperwork. Again, please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are also waiting.</li>
<br>
<li>TWO DEVICES ARE REQUIRED!!! There is NO EXCEPTION to this requirement. You must have a computer or laptop and a second device which will be a cellular phone, iPad, or tablet with a camera. BOTH devices will be active on the same Zoom link for the ENTIRE exam session.</li>
<br>
<li>Practice for your exam: It is your responsibility to be fully prepared since you will be taking the time of volunteers and a time slot from a long list of candidates. Be sure you are consistently scoring above an 88% on 15 or more practice tests before you schedule an exam.</li>
