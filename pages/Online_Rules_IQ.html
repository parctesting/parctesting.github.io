<li>A noisy environment will void your exam. This includes children, machinery, traffic, etc... You would not be permitted to have anyone with you at an in-person exam and the room has to be quiet. We expect the same an online exam. Even if the noise would not distract you, it will interfere with the exam and examiners proctoring the test. Therefore, you need to insure a quiet distraction free environment for the full duration of the exam. Find a sitter, send the people outside, find another location, or attend an in-person exam.</li></ol>
