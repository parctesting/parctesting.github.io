      <h2>HAM EXAM – ONLINE</h2>

      <p>
<h1>Read ALL instructions and requirements for online exams before paying or registering for an exam!</h1><br>
<h2>WARNING: Failure to pay for exam first will result in cancellation of your exam. You MUST pay immediately for your exam session or it will be cancelled without further notice!</h2><br>
If your PayPal email is not the same as the email you register with, we will not be able to match your payment to the exam. Make sure your name or your email match for PayPal and your registration. Email us immediately for any discrepancies. You may still receive a non-payment notice, since the system will not match up your payment automatically. Please be warned that variances in name and email can cause deletion.<br>
<h1>DO NOT REGISTER BEFORE YOU PAY FOR THE EXAM!</h1><br>
	  <center><a href="payhere.html"><button style="height:100px;width:200px"><h2>PAY HERE</h2></button></a></center>
<br>
<ul><li>PARC VE Testing Team has received permission of the ARRL VEC and the FCC to conduct completely online video-supervised testing with strict rules and protocols for maintaining the integrity of the testing environment.
You may sign up to be on the waiting list, but you may not sign up for an exam without going through the queue and being invited to do so.</li><br>
<li><p2>Be sure you are <strong>consistently scoring above an 85%</strong> on practice tests before you schedule an exam.</p2>
</li><br>
<li>The steps to sign up and register for an exam are:<br>
<ol><li><strong>Pay for an exam “PAY HERE” above.</strong> (We are not a business and do not make a profit, we are all volunteers. We pay a fee to PayPal when you use a credit card.)</li>
  <br>
<li><strong>Find and select a TIME SLOT using “Schedule” above.</strong> (A time slot is a time that you can expect to test, you will come in earlier than your time slot at the session time)</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Wait for an email containing a link to REGISTER for the exam session.</strong> (An exam session is a time period where several applicants are testing individually)</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Register for the exam session. </strong>You will receive a pin number for your session. We do NOT need this for your exam. It is confirmation of registering only!</li>
</ol><br>
</li>
<li>Please find a time slot in our schedule using the tab marked schedule above. This will be your time slot. </li>
<br>
<li>When we are experiencing very high demand, we will enable our waitlist. To get on the wait list for an exam, please sign up by selecting the WAITLIST button below. (Not used during times of low demand or current heavy scheduling.)</li>
</ul>
		  <center><a href="waitlist.html"><button type="button">Waitlist</button></a></center>

<br>
<br>
<h1>Warning: You must be fully prepared for an online exam</h1><br>
	<ul>
<li>The ONLINE system is much more complicated and time consuming than a regular in-person exam. You MUST read and follow all the protocol on this page. Exams require a minimum of 3 volunteer examiners per session and only 1 candidate can be tested by them at a time. To be sure no one can cheat, you will be asked to scan all around the room and verify the integrity of the exam environment. You and your exam session will be recorded. If you are not comfortable with this, please consider taking the exam in person at a future date.</li>
<br>
<li>Please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are waiting to take their exam after your exam is complete. You do this by being FULLY PREPARED. Please READ this page completely and also the FAQ page completely. Remember, this takes not only the time it takes to give you your exam, it also takes time for the VE’s to prepare for your exam and for the team to complete and submit your paperwork. Again, please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are also waiting.</li>
<br>
<li>TWO DEVICES ARE REQUIRED!!! There is NO EXCEPTION to this. You must have a computer or laptop and a second device which will be a cellular phone, iPad, or tablet with a camera. BOTH devices will be active on the same Zoom link for the ENTIRE exam session.</li>
<br>
<li>Practice for your exam: It is your responsibility to be fully prepared since you will be taking the time of volunteers and a time slot from a long list of candidates. Be sure you are consistently scoring above an 88% on 15 or more practice tests before you schedule an exam.</li>
<br>
<li>We strongly recommend that you do not use ham exam prep or any mobile app for taking practice exams, they typically do not provide you with enough of the question pool to pass the exam. We do recommend the below tools for preparing for your exam.</li>
<br>
		  
<li><a href="HamStudy.org">HamStudy.org</a>, a free site with lots of tips. It has an inexpensive companion <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hamstudy-org-desktop/id1386340628">phone app</a> you can use on the go.</li><br>
<li><a href="https://arrlexamreview.appspot.com">ARRL Exam Review for Ham Radio™</a>, a free site from the national group that you may want to join and use for referencing a wealth of information.</li><br>

<li><strong>PHOTO ID:</strong> A legal photo ID will need to be shown on camera to the VE Team. For online sessions the Exam Team will only accept US Passport or state-issued driver’s license or non-driver state ID for adults.</li>
<br>
<li>Under-18 students may show either of the above items, or student shows a school ID or report card and a legal guardian presents a photo ID. </li><br>
<li><strong>Parental Consent:</strong> For children age 13 and under, a parent must complete this COPPA Consent Form and follow directions for sending it.</li><br>
<li><strong>Federal Registration Number (FRN):</strong> If you do not have an FRN, you will be able to register for one at the web link we send you for the exam application. (The Exam Team will send you a link to an exam registration page.) Or, you can get an FRN ahead of time by visiting the FCC’s Registration page and clicking “Register for an FRN.”</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Exam Registration:</strong> Sometime before your scheduled exam you will receive a <strong>link to your specific exam session</strong> where you will fill out an exam registration. <strong>Please do this as soon as you receive the link.</strong> Your application will generate a <strong>4-digit access</strong> code which we will use to get your exam later.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>License Upgrading:</strong> If you plan to take the <strong>General</strong> or <strong>Amateur Extra</strong> exam, you must email to the <a href="vetesting@yahoo.com">Exam Team</a> an electronic copy of your current amateur radio license or any Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE) you may hold from previous exam sessions. Email them to vetesting@yahoo.com as a PDF file attachment before you register for the exam..</li>
<br>
<li><strong>One Exam per Session:</strong> Due to the current backlog of candidates on the waiting list and difficulty of administering exams online, you may take only ONE exam per session. If you do not pass an exam and want to re-test, you must make another appointment and pay the $15 fee. If you pass the exam and want to take the next one, for now you must make another appointment and pay another $15 fee.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Certificate of Successful Completion of Exam (CSCE):</strong> The Exam Manager will send you a CSCE that includes your digital signature that you will keep for your records when you pass any element. The instructions to retrieve your callsign are located above your digital signature on the CSCE.</li>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h4>Prepare your exam room BEFORE the exam:</h4>
<ul><body>
<li>An acceptable room is a room free of distractions and includes a door to prevent anyone from entering. Great choices are restrooms or closets, but these are not the only choices that work well.</li> 
<br>
<li>Please open any closet doors or shower curtains for the scan and then close them for the exam.</li>
<br>
<li>The following choices of a room are NOT allowed: No vehicles or outdoor locations and no location that has uncontrollable noise or distractions.</li>
<br>

<br>
<li>Clear the room of all non-exam materials, notes, books, posters, computer screens, or anything that could aid in taking the exam. Many people just use a bathroom, and that simplifies everything.</li>
<br>
<li>Clear your exam table and floor of ALL items within reach or view that would raise suspicion, such as papers, sticky notes, electronic items, monitors, headphones, drink containers, waste baskets, vapes, ashtrays, tobacco products, and anything unnecessary for the exam.</li>

<br>
<li>Clear the room of any distracting things that could take your attention off of the exam.</li>
<br>
<li>Warn family members not to enter the room during the exam. Also make sure they do not make any loud noises that can be heard in the exam session. This would include barking dogs or cats meowing loudly.</li>
<br>
<li>You must not have in the exam room any other people or pets.</li>
<br>
