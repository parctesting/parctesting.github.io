      <p>
<h1>Read ALL instructions and requirements for online exams before paying or registering for an exam!</h1><br><p><br>
<strong>Contact Us: </strong><br>
 <br>
Our Examiners are all volunteers, not employees. This is not a business, so we do not provide instant responses via email or phone. To reach us, please email the address provided at the bottom of each page. Given that our volunteers have regular jobs, responses may take up to 24 hours, excluding holidays or system outages. <br>
 <br>
Please refrain from contacting us or the FCC about your license status until ten business days have passed. For quick answers, refer to our FAQ section. Additionally, some of our retired members actively monitor our Facebook Group and can assist with questions there. Use the Facebook button on the Home Page to join the group. <br><br>

<center><div id="example2">Failure to thoroughly review both the procedures page and FAQ page on our website may lead to termination of your exam. Should we grant you access to the exam room and observe that you are unprepared or have not followed the specified procedures, you will be returned to the waiting room, and the next candidate will be considered. If unpreparedness persists on a subsequent attempt, you will be required to schedule a new exam.</div></center>
	  <br>
<p>If your Payment email is not the same as the email you register with, we will not be able to match your payment to the exam. Make sure your name or your email match for payment and your registration. Email us immediately for any discrepancies. You may still receive a non-payment notice, since the system will not match up your payment automatically. Please be warned that variances in name and email can cause deletion.</p><br>

<ul><li>PARC VE Testing Team has received permission of the ARRL VEC and the FCC to conduct completely online video-supervised testing with strict rules and protocols for maintaining the integrity of the testing environment.</li>
  <br>
<br>


</ul>

<h1>Warning: You must be fully prepared for an online exam</h1><br>
	<ul>

<li>The ONLINE system is  more complicated and time consuming than a regular in-person exam. You MUST read and follow all the protocol on this page. Exams require a minimum of 3 volunteer examiners per session and only 1 candidate can be tested by them at a time. To be sure no one can cheat, you will be asked to scan all around the room and verify the integrity of the exam environment. You and your exam session will be recorded. If you are not comfortable with this, please consider taking the exam in-person at a future date. By signing up for an exam, you agree that you will cover any sensitive items in the room or you consent to the scanning and recording of those items.</li>
<br>
<li>Please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are waiting to take their exam after your exam is complete. You do this by being FULLY PREPARED. Please READ this page completely and also the FAQ page completely. Remember, this takes not only the time it takes to give you your exam, it also takes time for the VE’s to prepare for your exam and for the team to complete and submit your paperwork. Again, please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are also waiting.</li>
<br>
<li>TWO DEVICES ARE REQUIRED!!! There is NO EXCEPTION to this requirement. You must have a computer or laptop and a second device which will be a cellular phone, iPad, or tablet with a camera. BOTH devices will be active on the same Zoom link for the ENTIRE exam session.</li>
<br>
<li>Practice for your exam: It is your responsibility to be fully prepared since you will be taking the time of volunteers and a time slot from a long list of candidates. Be sure you are consistently scoring above an 88% on 15 or more practice tests before you schedule an exam.</li>

<li>A noisy environment will void your exam. This includes children, machinery, traffic, etc... You would not be permitted to have anyone with you at an in-person exam and the room has to be quiet. We expect the same an online exam. Even if the noise would not distract you, it will interfere with the exam and examiners proctoring the test.

<h4>The Exam Manager will read the PROTOCOL for ONLINE Exams:</h4>
<ul><li>Protocol for Online Exams: (Read this now. The Exam Manager will read it to you again at the start of the exam.) (*Parent or guardian of a child candidate must be present for the rules and answer questions.)</li></ul>
<ol><li>You must complete the test without any interruptions that would raise suspicion about the integrity of the testing environment.</li> <br>
<li>You are asked to complete the exam within your assigned 15-minute time block, which is more than enough time for most candidates.</li>
<br>
<li>You agree to keep attention on your computer screen at all times. Eyes may not wander to other parts of the room and you may not leave your seat during the exam session. </li><br>
<li>You are not allowed to read the questions or answers out-loud.  You cannot talk to yourself. Mouthing the words even if no sound is coming out, is talking to yourself.&nbsp;</li>
<br>
<li>Please remove any drinks, snacks, or anything else from around your testing area that might distract you.</li><br>
<li>You may not have visitors or pets in the room during the exam and after exam, so please close and lock the doors.</li><br>
<li>You will use your cell phone camera to scan the room to show that there is nothing that could aid in taking the exam. By signing up for an exam, you agree that you will cover any sensitive items in the room or you consent to the scanning and recording of those items.</li>
<br>
<li>Then you will place your cell phone, so it views you, your keyboard, and both hands during the exam.&nbsp;</li>
<br>

<li>You will NOT be able to use scrap paper, manual calculators, or any other kind of assistance, however, if you wish, you may pre-load an on-screen calculator app. Do you want to use a calculator app? Make sure you have closed all of your browsers, email, and notes (THEY MUST BE QUIT COMPLETELY), the only thing that should be open now, is your calculator app and the zoom app!</li><br>
<li>You must agree to share your entire screen with the exam team, not just the browser. Do you agree to share your screen?</li> <br>
<li>You must agree that the exam session will be recorded and stored for up to 30 days in case of any question about a possible breach of exam protocol. Do you agree to be recorded?</li><br>
<li>You must agree that if the Exam Team suspects a possibility of cheating, the exam may be terminated and the exam fee forfeited, and you would be barred from taking future online exams. Do you agree?</li></ol><br>
<br>

<br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to leave the phone on and propped up at a distance aimed toward the computer, so that it can view you, your hands, and the computer.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to share via Zoom your full desktop, not just a browser window. You do this by selecting the green “SHARE SCREEN” button at the bottom center of the screen followed by selecting the blue “SHARE” button in the bottom right corner of the pop-up window.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to load and arrange a browser window in the middle of the screen (the exam questions are only 4 inches wide) and optionally position a calculator app next to it, and show that the calculator memory is clear.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to open your “Display Settings” to verify that there is only one video session running.</li><br>

<li>The Exam Manager will encourage you to join a local radio club for further learning opportunities.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will encourage you to join the American Radio Relay League, ARRL.ORG, for further learning opportunities and to support amateur radio on the national level.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will explain how to reach out to PARC or AUARC for any questions regarding exams and additional training. We strongly recommend certain types of training and are willing to offer options upon request. There are many courses offered in person and online and not all are the same. For online, we highly recommend New England Sci-Tec and can provide a referral if needed.</li><br>
<li>You are now free to leave the session. Click the red button in the bottom right corner of your screen that displays the word, “LEAVE”.  (The Exam Manager may disconnect the candidate from the session.)</li></ul><br>
