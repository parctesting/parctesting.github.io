<br>
<li>You must remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.</li>
<br>
<li>Make sure you remove any earpieces, headphones, hats, and show us that you are not wearing a watch on either wrist.</li>

<h5>(If there are multiple applicants, ask them to raise their hands)</h5><br>
<br>
<li>Please move the calculator app all the way to the left side of your screen. Put your calculator in 	standard/basic mode and make it as small as possible.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Is anyone using a Mac computer?</strong><br>
Look across your task bar for any dots under the applications. The only apps that may have a dot under them are the finder, Calculator, and Zoom apps. You MUST use force quit to close any extra apps. Look at the top left corner of your screen for the apple, then the fifth item down is force quit. Give me a thumbs up when you have completed this task. <br>

Give me a thumbs up when you have completed this task.<br>
<h5>*PAUSE AND VERIFY THEY FOUND IT*</h5><br>
Right click on the task bar to open Task Manager. (If this fails click CONTROL-SHIFT-ESCAPE all at once) Make sure all applications are closed except the ones we are using. Give me a thumbs up when you have completed this task.<br>
<h5>*PAUSE AND VERIFY THEY FOUND IT*</h5><br>
Right click in a blank area on your desktop, then click, “View”. Uncheck, “show icons”. Give me a thumbs up when you have completed this task. <br>
<h5>*PAUSE AND VERIFY THEY FOUND IT*</h5><br>

They will 	also require that you have a place to set your phone so that it views your computers monitor and keyboard. Take this time to remove any items or cover them with blankets or towels.
