<p2>WE WILL NOT TEST IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS:</p2><br>
<ol>
<li>We test US Citizens and those with a US Passport or qualifying documentation as listed in the ID requirements. Failure to provide approved ID will result in exam fee forfeiture.</li>
<li>We require a Driver’s License or State Issued ID. This must be an unexpired ID issued within the last five years or a Star ID issued within the last ten years. A US issued Passport with additional paperwork may be considered. If your identification is expired, you will need to get prior approval for the exam.</li>
<li>We will not test anyone outdoors or in any place other than a room that can be secured.</li>
<li>We will not test people in vehicles of any type whether moving or stationary.</li>
<li>A noisy environment will void your exam. This includes children, machinery, traffic, etc... You would not be permitted to have anyone with you at an in-person exam and the room has to be quiet. We expect the same an online exam. Even if the noise would not distract you, it will interfere with the exam and examiners proctoring the test. Therefore, you need to insure a quiet distraction free environment for the full duration of the exam. Find a sitter, send the people outside, find another location, or attend an in-person exam.</li></ol>
