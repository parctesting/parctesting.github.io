</li><br>
<li>Make sure you remove any earpieces, headphones, hats, and show us that you are not wearing a watch on either wrist.</li><br>

</li><br>
<li>Since you cannot use scrap paper or manual calculators, you can use an on-screen calculator app. If you would like to use a calculator app, please raise your hand for me now.
<ul>(If there are multiple applicants, ask them to raise their hands)</ul>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Is anyone using a PC?</strong></li><br>
	<ul>
<li>Look across your task bar for any bars or lines under the applications. The only apps that may have a line under them are the Calculator and Zoom apps. You will also need to go to the bottom right-hand corner of the screen and look to the right of the time and date. You are looking for a text balloon, it may or may not have a number on it, and right click on it. Then click focus assist followed by clicking priority only.

</li><br>
