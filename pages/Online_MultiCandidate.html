<strong>Contact Us: </strong><br>
 <br>
Our Examiners are all volunteers, not employees. This is not a business, so we do not provide instant responses via email or phone. To reach us, please email the address provided at the bottom of each page. Given that our volunteers have regular jobs, responses may take up to 24 hours, excluding holidays or system outages. <br>
 <br>
Please refrain from contacting us or the FCC about your license status until ten business days have passed. For quick answers, refer to our FAQ section. Additionally, some of our retired members actively monitor our Facebook Group and can assist with questions there. Use the Facebook button on the Home Page to join the group. <br><br>

<center><div id="example2">Failure to thoroughly review both the procedures page and FAQ page on our website may lead to termination of your exam. Should we grant you access to the exam room and observe that you are unprepared or have not followed the specified procedures, you will be returned to the waiting room, and the next candidate will be considered. If unpreparedness persists on a subsequent attempt, you will be required to schedule a new exam.</div></center>
	  <br>
<p>If your Payment email is not the same as the email you register with, we will not be able to match your payment to the exam. Make sure your name or your email match for payment and your registration. Email us immediately for any discrepancies. You may still receive a non-payment notice, since the system will not match up your payment automatically. Please be warned that variances in name and email can cause deletion.</p><br>

<ul><li>PARC VE Testing Team has received permission of the ARRL VEC and the FCC to conduct completely online video-supervised testing with strict rules and protocols for maintaining the integrity of the testing environment.</li>
  <br>
<br>


</ul>

<h1>Warning: You must be fully prepared for an online exam</h1><br>
	<ul>

<li>The ONLINE system is  more complicated and time consuming than a regular in-person exam. You MUST read and follow all the protocol on this page. Exams require a minimum of 3 volunteer examiners per session and only 1 candidate can be tested by them at a time. To be sure no one can cheat, you will be asked to scan all around the room and verify the integrity of the exam environment. You and your exam session will be recorded. If you are not comfortable with this, please consider taking the exam in-person at a future date. By signing up for an exam, you agree that you will cover any sensitive items in the room or you consent to the scanning and recording of those items.</li>
<br>
<li>Please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are waiting to take their exam after your exam is complete. You do this by being FULLY PREPARED. Please READ this page completely and also the FAQ page completely. Remember, this takes not only the time it takes to give you your exam, it also takes time for the VE’s to prepare for your exam and for the team to complete and submit your paperwork. Again, please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are also waiting.</li>
<br>
<li>TWO DEVICES ARE REQUIRED!!! There is NO EXCEPTION to this requirement. You must have a computer or laptop and a second device which will be a cellular phone, iPad, or tablet with a camera. BOTH devices will be active on the same Zoom link for the ENTIRE exam session.</li>
<br>
<li>Practice for your exam: It is your responsibility to be fully prepared since you will be taking the time of volunteers and a time slot from a long list of candidates. Be sure you are consistently scoring above an 88% on 15 or more practice tests before you schedule an exam.</li>

<li><strong>Parental Consent:</strong> For children age 13 and under, a parent must complete this COPPA Consent Form and follow directions for submitting it.</li><br>
<li><strong>Federal Registration Number (FRN):</strong> If you do not have an FRN, you will be able to register for one at the web link we send you for the exam application.

Email them to vetesting@yahoo.com as a PDF file attachment before you register for the exam..</li>
<br>
<li><strong>One Exam per Session:</strong> Due to the difficulty and time requirements of administering exams online, you may take only one exam per time slot. If you do not pass an exam and want to re-test, you must make another appointment at another time which can be the same day. You will have to pay the $15 fee for each retest. We do not offer additional exams at the same session online <u>without advance request, approval, and scheduling.</u></li>
<br>
