<h5>(If it is an iPhone ask them to click on cancel)<br>
 (If it is something else, ask them to click on your image, not any of the selections in the dialogue box)</h5><br>
<br><p4>This is a timed exam, so you will need to complete the test without any interruptions.<br>
<br><p4>You do this by keeping your attention on your computer screen at all times and don’t leave your seat during the exam.
<br><p4>Also, you cannot read any questions or answers out loud and you cannot talk to yourself.<br>
<br><p4>You need to remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.<br>
<br><p4>You cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors.<br>
<br><p4>Since you cannot use scrap paper or manual calculators, you can use an on-screen calculator app.
(Applicant's Name) you want to use a calculator app?<br>
<br><p4>Go ahead and move the calculator app all the way to the left side of your screen.<br>
<br><p4>You should only have on your screen the calculator app and the Zoom app. All browsers, emails, notifications, and notes must not only be closed, they have to be shut down and quit completely.<br>
<br><p4><strong>FOR THE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS, WE NEED A SIMPLE YES OR NO.</strong><br>
