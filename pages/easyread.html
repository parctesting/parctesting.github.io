EASY READ SCRIPT
SESSION BEGIN

ATTENTION: All VE’s please mute your microphone at this time.

Before we begin, we want to bring your phone into the session. Is your phone and iPhone or something else? 
(If it is an iPhone ask them to click on cancel) 
(If it is something else, ask them to click on your image, not any of the selections in the dialogue box)

This is a timed exam, so please complete the test without any interruptions.

You do this by keeping your attention on your computer screen at all times and don’t leave your seat during the exam.

You are not allowed to read any questions or answers out loud and you cannot talk to yourself.

At this time, you need to remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.

Also, you cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors.

You cannot use scrap paper or manual calculators, but you can pre-load on your screen a calculator app. ______ do you want to use a calculator app?

Please move the calculator app all the way to the left side of your screen.

At this time, you should only have on your screen the calculator app and the Zoom app. All browsers, emails, notifications, and notes must not only be closed, they have to be shut down and quit completely.

FOR THE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS, WE NEED A SIMPLE YES OR NO.

Do you agree to share your entire screen?

Do you agree that the exam session will be recorded?

Do you understand that if the Exam Team suspects cheating, they will terminate your exam, you will forfeit your fee, and be barred from taking any future online exams?


IDENTIFICATION

Great, now please hold your driver’s license up to the camera on your computer screen close and steady.

Flip it around to the back side.

Put that in your back pocket or a drawer so it is out of view, along with any other papers or documents.


*STOP HERE FOR MULTI-CANDIDATE INSTRUCTIONS - BEGIN BELOW FOR INDIVIDUAL READING OF INSTRUCTIONS*
ROOM SCAN

Now take your cellphone, change to your rear camera, not your selfie camera. Stand up and step away from your computer at least 6 feet. Point your camera back toward your computer and scan the area.

Standing in the center of the room, make a 360 degree turn without stopping in the same direction with your camera.

Reverse your camera back to the selfie camera and place your phone where it views your monitor, keyboard, and hands.


SCREEN SHARE

On your computer select the “SHARE SCREEN” button at the bottom of the screen. It is the green button.

Then press the blue “SHARE” button in the bottom right hand corner of that dialog box. 

* DO NOT READ * Make sure all apps and processes are quit except for zoom and a calculator app.

VERIFY Move the calculator to the left side of the screen.

Open the browser and narrow it down so that it fits between the calculator app and the zoom app. The exam is only 3 to 4 inches wide so narrow it down now.

Type in the URL bar at the top of the browser “EXAM.TOOLS” and press enter.

Select “JOIN EXAM SESSION”.

On the top line type the callsign “KJ4PJE”.

On the next line type ____ (pin number).

Click “JOIN SESSION”.


START EXAM

Remember, to keep both eyes on the screen at all times. Don’t read any questions or answers out loud and don’t talk to yourself.

After you verify your information is correct please click “START _____ EXAM”

In the top right corner, you will see the number of questions remaining. Please move your cursor up to that spot now. You will not need to use your mouse or trackpad unless you need to use your calculator.

When you have answered all of the questions that will change to a “GRADE EXAM” button. After you finish, press the GRADE EXAM without any further prompting from us, and we will come back with your score.

To take the exam you MUST press the “A”, “B”, “C”, or “D” keys on your keyboard to answer the questions. This will answer the question and advance to the next question automatically. It will bottom justify the questions because some questions have schematics above them.

We will now turn off all of our video and audio so that we don’t distract you. However, you must keep both of your devices active throughout the exam.

GOOD LUCK! You may begin!

FINISH EXAM

Okay! You may now click the “GRADE EXAM” button and we will get your score.

Click on the “FINISH AND SIGN FORMS” button.

Click on “FINISH AND SIGN”

Now scroll to the bottom of the page and scribble your signature into the “SIGN HERE” box.

Once you have finished with your signature, click on “SIGN DOCUMENTS”, the green button below the box.

Click on “FINISH SESSION”.
We will now stop recording and sharing your screen.

Click on “LOG OUT”


POST EXAM INFORMATION

We will be emailing you a CSCE that includes instructions on how you can go online and get your callsign. (or upgrade) It should be available online by the end of next week.

We encourage you to join the ARRL and get involved in your local radio club when and if you can.

Thank you for taking an exam with us. You and your friends are welcome to take a future exam. We look forward to hearing you on the air soon.
