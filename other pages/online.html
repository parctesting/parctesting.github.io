      <h3>HAM EXAM – ONLINE – BY INVITATION ONLY</h3>

      <p>
Read ALL instructions and requirements for online exams before paying or registering for an exam!<br>
WARNING: Failure to pay for exam first will result in cancellation of your exam. You MUST pay immediately for your exam session or it will be cancelled without further notice!<br>
If your PayPal email is not the same as the email you register with, we will not be able to match your payment to the exam. Make sure your name or your email match for PayPal and your registration. Email us immediately for any discrepancies. You may still receive a non-payment notice, since the system will not match up your payment automatically. Please be warned that variances in name and email can cause deletion.<br>
DO NOT REGISTER BEFORE YOU PAY FOR THE EXAM!<br>
<br>
PARC VE Testing Team has received permission of the ARRL VEC and the FCC to conduct completely online video-supervised testing with strict rules and protocols for maintaining the integrity of the testing environment.
You may sign up to be on the waiting list, but you may not sign up for an exam without going through the queue and being invited to do so.<br>
We will give priority in this order: (1) anyone who has been enrolled in one our radio courses, (2) AE candidates who need the test before the June 30th question pool change, (3) the general public.<br>
Be sure you are consistently scoring above an 85% on practice tests before you schedule an exam.<br>
Please find a session at hamstudy.org, if there are no sessions available, you can register on our waitlist and then email us at vetesting@yahoo.com to let us know you are on the waitlist and what times you are available to test. To get on the wait list for an exam, please sign up here.<br>
		  </a><button type="button"><a href="waitlist.html">Waitlist</a></button>

<br>
<br>
Warning: You must be fully prepared for an online exam<br>
The ONLINE system is much more complicated and time consuming than a regular in-person exam. You MUST read and follow all the protocol on this page. Exams require a minimum of 3 volunteer examiners per session and only 1 candidate can be tested by them at a time. To be sure no one can cheat, you will be asked to scan all around the room and verify the integrity of the exam environment. You and your exam session will be recorded. If you are not comfortable with this, please consider taking the exam in person at a future date.<br>
Practice for your exam: It is your responsibility to be fully prepared since you will be taking the time of volunteers and a time slot from a long list of candidates. Be sure you are consistently scoring above an 85% on practice tests before you schedule an exam.<br>

If you do not pass an exam and want to re-test, you must make another appointment and pay the $15 fee. If you pass the exam and want to take the next one, for now you must make another appointment and pay another $15 fee.<br>
Certificate of Successful Completion of Exam (CSCE):  The Exam Manager will send you a CSCE that includes your digital signature that you will keep for your records when you pass any element. The instructions to retrieve your callsign are located above your digital signature on the CSCE.<br>
<br>
Prepare your exam room BEFORE the exam:<br>
An acceptable room is a room free of distractions and includes a door to prevent anyone from entering. Great choices are restrooms or closets, but these are not the only choices that work well. Please open any closet doors or shower curtains for the scan and then close them for the exam.<br>
The following choices of a room are NOT allowed: No vehicles or outdoor locations and no location that has uncontrollable noise or distractions.<br>
Clear the room of all non-exam materials, notes, books, posters, computer screens, or anything that could aid in taking the exam. Many people just use a bathroom, and that simplifies everything.<br>
Clear your exam table and floor of ALL items within reach or view that would raise suspicion, such as papers, sticky notes, electronic items, monitors, headphones, drink containers, waste baskets, and anything unnecessary for the exam.
Clear the room of any distracting things that could take your attention off of the exam. No drinks, no food, no hat or watch.<br>
Clear the room of all amateur radio related materials, notes, books, posters, computer screens, or anything that could aid in taking the exam.<br>
Clear the room of any distracting things that could take your attention off of the exam.
Warn family members not to enter the room during the exam.<br>
You must not have in the exam room any other people or pets.<br>
When in Waiting Room, do NOT test screen share or any other functions of zoom, doing so will result in you being removed from the session!!!<br></p>

You must complete the test without any interruptions that would raise suspicion about the integrity of the testing environment. <br>

The Exam Manager will ask you to leave the phone on and propped up at a distance aimed toward the computer, so that it can view you, your hands, and the computer.<br>
The Exam Manager will ask you to share via Zoom your full desktop, not just a browser window. You do this by selecting the green “SHARE SCREEN” button at the bottom center of the screen followed by selecting the blue “SHARE” button in the bottom right corner of the pop-up window.<br>
The Exam Manager will ask you to load and arrange a browser window in the middle of the screen (the exam questions are only 4 inches wide) and optionally position a calculator app next to it, and show that the calculator memory is clear.

The Exam Manager will email you the Certificate of Successful Completion of Exam (CSCE) within 48 hours.<br>
The Exam Manager will explain that your exam application and scores will be uploaded electronically this evening, so your license will appear in the FCC database within about 5-7 working days.<br>
The Exam Manager will encourage you to join a local radio club for further learning opportunities.<br>
The Exam Manager will encourage you to join the Amateur Radio Relay League, ARRL.ORG, for further learning opportunities and to support amateur radio on the national level.<br>
The Exam Manager will explain how to reach out to PARC or AUARC for any questions regarding exams and additional training.
