<br>
<br><p4>We will need you to complete the test without any interruptions.<br>

<br><p4>You need to remove any drinks, snacks, papers, or anything else that might distract you including vapes and tobacco products.<br>
<br><p4>You cannot have any visitors or pets in the room, so please close and lock all doors.<br>
<br><p4>Since you cannot use scrap paper or manual calculators, you can use an on-screen calculator app.
(Applicant's Name) you want to use a calculator app?<br>
<br><p4>Go ahead and move the calculator app all the way to the left side of your screen.<br>
<br><p4>You should only have on your screen the calculator app and the Zoom app. All browsers, emails, notifications, and notes must not only be closed, they have to be shut down and quit completely.<br>
<br><p4><strong>FOR THE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS, WE NEED A SIMPLE YES OR NO.</strong><br>
