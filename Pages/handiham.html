<strong>Amateur Radio for People with Disabilities</strong><br>
 <br>


Amateur radio is for everyone. No matter your physical ability, hearing or vision, you have a place in this community. We believe that radio is a powerful way to connect with others, learn new skills, and be part of a worldwide network of support and friendship.<br>
<br>
We are proud supporters and advocates of HandiHam, a long-standing organization that helps people with disabilities enjoy and succeed in amateur radio. Whether you are blind, deaf, hard of hearing, physically impaired, or live with another condition that makes learning or operating radio more challenging, we are here to help.<br>
<br>
<strong>Getting Started</strong><br>
Amateur radio is more accessible than ever. From voice and digital modes to Morse code, there is something for everyone. If you use assistive technologies like screen readers, speech-to-text, or adaptive keyboards, many tools and radios are compatible or can be modified to fit your needs.<br>
<br>
You do not need to have full use of your hands, hearing, or eyesight to be an excellent radio operator. There are ways to operate radios using foot pedals, speech recognition, braille displays, and even sip-and-puff devices. You also don’t need to be able to speak—many operators communicate using keyboards and text-based modes.<br>
<br>
Studying for the Exam<br>
We can connect you with resources designed to help people with disabilities prepare for the amateur radio exam, including:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Audio and braille study guides</li>
<li>Screen reader–friendly online courses</li>
<li>Deaf-accessible video content with captions and sign language</li>
<li>One-on-one support from mentors and volunteers</li>
</ul><br>
If you need help or specific accommodations for your exam, let us know. We will work with you and the Volunteer Examiner team to make sure you get the support you need to test with confidence.<br>
<br>
We Are Here for You<br>
You are welcome here. We believe amateur radio is stronger when it includes everyone. We will do our part to support you, answer your questions, and walk with you through every step of your journey—from first learning about radio to earning your license and beyond.<br>
<br>
If you are interested or need assistance, please contact us. We will connect you with a friendly volunteer who understands your needs and will help guide you through the process.<br>
<br>
Let’s make radio inclusive, together.<br>
