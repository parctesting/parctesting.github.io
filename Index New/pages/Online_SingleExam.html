<h1>Read ALL instructions and requirements for online exams before paying or registering for an exam!</h1><br>
<center><div id="example2">Failure to read the entire procedures page on our website and the FAQ page, may result in termination of your exam. If we admit you to the exam room and notice that you are not prepared or set up according to the procedures, we will put you back in the waiting room and go to the next person. If you are not prepared a second time, you will need to schedule a new exam.</div></center>
	  <br>
<p>If your Payment email is not the same as the email you register with, we will not be able to match your payment to the exam. Make sure your name or your email match for payment and your registration. Email us immediately for any discrepancies. You may still receive a non-payment notice, since the system will not match up your payment automatically. Please be warned that variances in name and email can cause deletion.</p><br>

<ul><li>PARC VE Testing Team has received permission of the ARRL VEC and the FCC to conduct completely online video-supervised testing with strict rules and protocols for maintaining the integrity of the testing environment.</li>
  <br>
<br>


</ul>

<h1>Warning: You must be fully prepared for an online exam</h1><br>
	<ul>
<li>The ONLINE system is  more complicated and time consuming than a regular in-person exam. You MUST read and follow all the protocol on this page. Exams require a minimum of 3 volunteer examiners per session and only 1 candidate can be tested by them at a time. To be sure no one can cheat, you will be asked to scan all around the room and verify the integrity of the exam environment. You and your exam session will be recorded. If you are not comfortable with this, please consider taking the exam in-person at a future date.</li>
<br>
<li>Please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are waiting to take their exam after your exam is complete. You do this by being FULLY PREPARED. Please READ this page completely and also the FAQ page completely. Remember, this takes not only the time it takes to give you your exam, it also takes time for the VE’s to prepare for your exam and for the team to complete and submit your paperwork. Again, please respect the time of the volunteers and those candidates that are also waiting.</li>
<br>
<li>TWO DEVICES ARE REQUIRED!!! There is NO EXCEPTION to this requirement. You must have a computer or laptop and a second device which will be a cellular phone, iPad, or tablet with a camera. BOTH devices will be active on the same Zoom link for the ENTIRE exam session.</li>
<br></ul>
<h1>How to register for a session:</h1><br>

<ol>
 
<li><strong>First you need to schedule. Do this by finding and select an available TIME SLOT using the tab “Schedule” above</strong> (A time slot is a time that you can expect to test, you will come in earlier than your time slot at the session time) <strong><p2>This is when you pay.</p2></strong></li> 
<br>
<li><strong>Pay for the exam when you schedule.</strong> (We are not a business and do not make a profit, we are all volunteers. We pay a fee to PayPal, Stripe, or the Processor when you use a credit card. Payment will be made in the schedule tab.)</li><br>
<li><strong>Watch for an email containing a link to REGISTER for the exam session.</strong> (An exam session is a time period where several applicants are testing individually)</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Register for the exam session. </strong>You will receive a pin number for your session. We do NOT need this for your exam. It is confirmation of registering only!</li>
</ol><ul>
<li><p2>Be sure you are <strong>consistently scoring above an 88%</strong> on practice tests before you schedule an exam.</p2>
</li><br>
<li><p2>Exam Fee Payment:</p2> You <u><strong>must pay</strong></u> the <u><strong>$15 exam fee</strong></u> when you select your time-slot electronically through PARC VE TESTING via PayPal, Stripe, or the Processor. You must do this when you schedule your time-slot for your exam. Please do not check the goods and service box.</li><br>
<li>	  
<p2>Basic Qualification Question:</p2> Applicants are required to answer the FCC basic qualification question (felony question). If an applicant answers YES, they must submit the required documentation directly to FCC as outlined in these instructions <a href="http://www.arrl.org/fcc-qualification-question">http://www.arrl.org/fcc-qualification-question</a>, and reference the application file number. The candidate must take action within 14 days of the application filing date, or the application will be dismissed by FCC. The candidate should not communicate any information or documents to the Volunteer Examiner team or the VEC.</li><br>
<li>WARNING: Failure to pay for the exam will result in cancellation without further notice.</li><br>
<li>Please do not pay using the pay tab above, the payment is made when you schedule a time-slot under the schedule tab. Failure to follow these instructions may cause a double payment resulting in additional fees for us as well. Thank you for reading all of the instructions.</li><br>
<li>Please find a time slot in our schedule using the tab marked schedule above. This will be your time slot. </li>

Email them to vetesting@yahoo.com as a PDF file attachment before you register for the exam..</li>
<br>
<li><strong>One Exam per Session:</strong> Due to the difficulty and time requirements of administering exams online, you may take only one exam per time slot. If you do not pass an exam and want to re-test, you must make another appointment at another time which can be the same day. You will have to pay the $15 fee for each retest. We do not offer additional exams at the same session online <u>without advance request, approval, and scheduling.</u></li>
<br>
<li><strong>Certificate of Successful Completion of Exam (CSCE):</strong> The Exam Manager will send you a CSCE that includes your digital signature that you will keep for your records when you pass any element within 72 hours of exam completion.

<h4>The Exam Manager will read the PROTOCOL for ONLINE Exams:</h4>
<ul><li>Protocol for Online Exams: (Read this now. The Exam Manager will read it to you again at the start of the exam.) (*Parent or guardian of a child candidate must be present for the rules and answer questions.)</li></ul>
<ol><li>You must complete the test without any interruptions that would raise suspicion about the integrity of the testing environment.</li> <br>
<li>You are asked to complete the exam within your assigned 15-minute time block, which is more than enough time for most candidates.</li>
<br>
<li>You agree to keep attention on your computer screen at all times. Eyes may not wander to other parts of the room and you may not leave your seat during the exam session. </li><br>
<li>You are not allowed to read the questions or answers out-loud.  You cannot talk to yourself. Mouthing the words even if no sound is coming out, is talking to yourself.&nbsp;</li>
<br>
<li>Please remove any drinks, snacks, or anything else from around your testing area that might distract you.</li><br>
<li>You may not have visitors or pets in the room during the exam and after exam, so please close and lock the doors.</li><br>
<li>You will use your cell phone camera to scan the room to show that there is nothing that could aid in taking the exam.</li><br>
<li>Then you will place your cell phone, so it views you, your keyboard, and both hands during the exam.</li><br>
<li>You will NOT be able to use scrap paper, manual calculators, or any other kind of assistance, however, if you wish, you may pre-load an on-screen calculator app. Do you want to use a calculator app? Make sure you have closed all of your browsers, email, and notes (THEY MUST BE QUIT COMPLETELY), the only thing that should be open now, is your calculator app and the zoom app!</li><br>
<li>You must agree to share your entire screen with the exam team, not just the browser. Do you agree to share your screen?</li> <br>
<li>You must agree that the exam session will be recorded and stored for up to 30 days in case of any question about a possible breach of exam protocol. Do you agree to be recorded?</li><br>
<li>You must agree that if the Exam Team suspects a possibility of cheating, the exam may be terminated and the exam fee forfeited, and you would be barred from taking future online exams. Do you agree?</li></ol><br>
<br>
<p2><strong>At this point the Exam Manager will follow this procedure:</strong></p2><br>
<ul>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to show your picture ID, front and back, in the camera until every examiner can verify your identity.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will now turn on the recorder to record your screen, your web cam, and your phone camera view.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to use your phone camera and step back to show the computer and workspace, scan around the room, including walls and floor, under table and chair, under laptop and keyboard, with a closeup of the computer, keyboard, hands, and arms.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to leave the phone on and propped up at a distance aimed toward the computer, so that it can view you, your hands, and the computer.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to share via Zoom your full desktop, not just a browser window. You do this by selecting the green “SHARE SCREEN” button at the bottom center of the screen followed by selecting the blue “SHARE” button in the bottom right corner of the pop-up window.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to load and arrange a browser window in the middle of the screen (the exam questions are only 4 inches wide) and optionally position a calculator app next to it, and show that the calculator memory is clear.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to open your “Display Settings” to verify that there is only one video session running.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to type in the browser address field an address to load the exam engine. The Exam Manager will ask you to click on “JOIN EXAM SESSION”.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to enter the session manager’s call sign and your 4-digit exam code. The Session Callsign is KJ4PJE.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will remotely give credentials to access an exam session. Please verify your name, address, and phone number at this point. After the exam, any changes will result in voiding the exam. Changes can only be made at this point.</li> <br>
<li>Please verify your name, address, and phone number at this point. After the exam, any changes will result in voiding the exam. Changes can be made only at this point.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will tell you that when you finish the exam to press the Grade Exam button at the bottom of the page or the top right corner.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will ask you to keep your attention on the screen and keep your camera and microphone on.</li><br>
<li>All Exam Team members now shut off their video and microphones. The exam will now begin. You can shortcut to the next question by pressing the RIGHT ARROW KEY on your keyboard.</li><br>
<li>When you finish, press the Grade Exam button, and your score will show. We are unable to show which specific questions you missed.</li><br>
<li>Now the Exam Manager will ask you to click Finish and Sign Forms button, then verify your name and address on the screen, then electronically sign your name at the bottom to complete your exam application and CSCE.</li><br>
<li>You will now click the Finish Session button.</li><br>
<li>Then click the LOGOUT button.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager now turns OFF the recorder and releases your shared screen.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will email you the Certificate of Successful Completion of Exam (CSCE) within 48 hours.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will explain that your exam application and scores will be uploaded electronically this evening, so your license will appear in the FCC database within about 5-7 working days.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will encourage you to join a local radio club for further learning opportunities.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will encourage you to join the American Radio Relay League, ARRL.ORG, for further learning opportunities and to support amateur radio on the national level.</li><br>
<li>The Exam Manager will explain how to reach out to PARC or AUARC for any questions regarding exams and additional training. We strongly recommend certain types of training and are willing to offer options upon request. There are many courses offered in person and online and not all are the same. For online, we highly recommend New England Sci-Tec and can provide a referral if needed.</li><br>
<li>You are now free to leave the session. Click the red button in the bottom right corner of your screen that displays the word, “LEAVE”.  (The Exam Manager may disconnect the candidate from the session.)</li></ul></p>
